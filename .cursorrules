// Project-wide rules for AI in Cursor (memeic)

Always:
- Use latest compatible package versions (no pins) in `pubspec.yaml`.
- Keep a single flavor only; use `FlavorConfig.instance.values` with one default.
- Fix all lints introduced by edits before finishing.
- Prefer absolute paths when referencing files.
- Maintain existing indentation style; do not reformat unrelated code.
- Remove dead imports/usages and missing-module references on sight.
- Keep `ApiClient` self-contained (no external app_config/user_service).
- Use `memeic` package imports, never other app package names.
- Always use `Logger` instead of `print` for diagnostics.
- Generate code via `stacked generate` where applicable; don't handwire what generator handles.
- Keep all view logic in ViewModels; Views only for rendering and event wiring.
- Use enums for UI states and types (e.g., button states/types) instead of booleans.

Models:
- Always use `freezed` and `json_serializable` style with `freezed_annotation` for models.
- Place models under `lib/models/`.
- Organize by module: e.g., `lib/models/auth/`, `lib/models/user/`, etc.
- Generate code with `build_runner` (`*.freezed.dart`, `*.g.dart`).

Editing:
- If adding deps → update `pubspec.yaml` without version pins.
- If changing helpers → keep `api_client.dart`, `app_error.dart`, `shared_prefs.dart`, `url_provider.dart` consistent.
- Default logging ON in dev-equivalent settings via `FlavorConfig.values.enableLogging`.
 - Use `ui/common/` as shared widgets folder (general purpose widgets live here).
 - Views may have a `widgets/` subfolder for view-specific widgets not shared.
 - Prefer placeholder assets when referenced assets are not present, do not block.

Testing & CI:
- Ensure `flutter pub get` resolves with no analyzer errors after changes.
- Prefer adding small unit tests for new helpers/models when reasonable.

Security:
- Never log secrets or tokens. If tokens are needed, read from secure storage and redact in logs.

PR Hygiene:
- Keep edits minimal in scope; avoid unrelated formatting changes.
